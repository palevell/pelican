excerpt:    This script chooses a random theme from pelican-themes--great for testing!

To streamline testing operations, I opted to move the theme-picker out of the pelican settings file.

With this setup, this script `random_theme` can be executed before building the site, as shown in the following example:

```bash
./random_theme ; make clean devserver
```

-- Enjoy!
