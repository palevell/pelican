After speeding through several Pelican themes, I have noticed a few things...

- Many of the themes don't seem to work, anymore 
  (UPDATE: most of them need the *i18n_subsites* plugin)
- Themes I like:
	- pelican-twitchy
	- bold
	- Just Read
- Boostrap colour schemes that are worth exploring:
	- simplex
- Themes I like, but need improvement:
	- Pelican Blue
	- Monospace
- Themes with tweet display potential:
	- New Bootstrap2
- Incomplete themes, can be deleted:
	- lazystrap
	- niu-x2
- Themes with images:
	- SoMA
