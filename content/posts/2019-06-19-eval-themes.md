After speeding through several Pelican themes, I have noticed a few things...

- Many of the themes don't seem to work, anymore 
  (UPDATE: most of them need the *i18n_subsites* plugin)
- Themes I like:
	- pelican-twitchy
	- bold
	- Just Read
	- Genus
	- bricks
	- Atilla
	- **materialistic** (very much!)
	- **Plumage**
	- pelican-cait
- Boostrap colour schemes that are worth exploring:
	- simplex
- Themes I like, but need improvement:
	- Pelican Blue
	- Monospace
	- Taman
	- voidy-bootstrap
	- nikhil-theme
	- bootstrap
- Themes with tweet display potential:
	- New Bootstrap2
- Incomplete themes, can be deleted:
	- lazystrap
	- niu-x2
- Themes with images:
	- SoMA
	- Taman
	- Atilla
	
### Notes
Theme | Score | Comments | 
--- | :---: | ---
genus | 5 | simple, no menus, categories, or tags
chunk | 5 | simple, no excerpts
clean-blog | 4 | social media sharing buttons don't work
pelican-hss | 4 | needs work
html5-dopetrope | 3 | columns are nice, but don't handle GitHub gists well
Flex | 7 | I like this one--it's clean and easy to navigate; I hope I can change the masthead
