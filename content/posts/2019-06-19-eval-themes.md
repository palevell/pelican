After speeding through several Pelican themes, I have noticed a few things...

- Many of the themes don't seem to work, anymore 
  (UPDATE: most of them need the *i18n_subsites* plugin)
	
### Notes
Theme | Score | Comments | 
--- | :---: | ---
genus | 5 | simple, no menus, categories, or tags
chunk | 5 | simple, no excerpts
clean-blog | 4 | social media sharing buttons don't work
pelican-hss | 4 | needs work
html5-dopetrope | 3 | columns are nice, but don't handle GitHub gists well
Flex | 7 | I like this one--it's clean and easy to navigate; I hope I can change the masthead
medius | 8 | plain, simple, elegant, clean, easy to navigate; 
medius | 8 | no images, contact info, or social media;  
medius | 8 | good for focusing on content; 
medius | 8 | tables could be fancier, but it's okay.
svbtle | 6 | plain & simple, don't like "Patrick" in sidebar, instead of "Pelican"
nikhil-theme | 5 | this looks like a theme for log entries, which may be okay for indexing Top XX Lists, but it is boring, and needs work
pelican-fh5co-marble | 4 | columnar, doesn't handle embedded objects nicely in columns--too bad
Nuja | 6 | Nice card-style layout, a tad buggy
sundown | 4 | Okay layout, okay tables, too light
nest | 1 | Too much doesn't work
elegant | 2 | simple, but buggy, could work for logs
semantic-ui | 4 | I like it, but the title is cut-off
uikit | 5 | Buggy
Just-Read | 6 | still okay
pelican-twitcy | 7 | I like it, but the share buttons don't work.
